        <!-- redacted from Tim Berners-Lee's WikiPedia page -->
        <p>After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at a telecommunications company in Poole. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.</p>

        <p>Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>
